            Bohemian Rhapsody is a 2018 biographical film about the British rock band <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span>. 
            It follows singer Freddie Mercury's life leading to <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span>'s Live Aid performance at Wembley Stadium in 1985. 
            The film is a British-American joint venture produced by 20th Century Fox, New Regency, GK Films, and <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span> Films, with Fox serving as distributor.

            Directed by Bryan Singer, it is written by Anthony McCarten, produced by Graham King and former <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span> manager Jim Beach. 
            It stars Rami Malek as Mercury, with Lucy Boynton, Gwilym Lee, Ben Hardy, Joseph Mazzello, Aidan Gillen, Tom Hollander, Allen Leech and Mike Myers in supporting roles. <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span>

            Bohemian Rhapsody was announced in 2010, with Sacha Baron Cohen cast as Mercury. After Baron Cohen left the project in 2013 following creative differences with producers, the project languished for several years before 
            Malek was cast in November 2016. Principal photography began in London in September 2017 with Singer as director. In December 2017, Singer was fired for absence and clashing with the cast and crew, 
            and Dexter Fletcher was hired to complete the film. Singer retained sole director credit as per DGA guidelines, while Fletcher received an executive producer credit. Filming concluded in January 2018.

            Bohemian Rhapsody was released in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2018 and in the United States on 2 November 2018, and has grossed over $286 million worldwide on a production budget of about $50 million, 
            becoming the highest-grossing musical biographical film of all time. The film received mixed reviews from critics; its portrayal of Mercury's sexuality and the other band members was criticized, 
            but Malek's performance received praise. Several historical inaccuracies were highlighted.

    <h2> Plot - Spoilers ahead! </h2>

    <div>
        <p>
            In 1970, Farrokh Bulsara, an Indian-British Parsi college student and baggage handler at Heathrow Airport, watches a local band who he has been following for a while, named Smile, perform at a nightclub. 
            After the show, he meets Smile guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor, and offers to replace their singer Tim Staffell, who has quit the band to join Humpy Bong. With the addition of bassist John Deacon, 
            the band – now known as <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span> – plays gigs across Britain until they sell their van to produce their debut album. 
            Their musical style lands them a contract with EMI Records. At the same time, Farrokh legally changes his name to Freddie Mercury and becomes engaged to Biba store clerk Mary Austin. 
            The album hits the charts in America, and during the band's U.S. tour, Freddie begins to question his sexuality.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1975, <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span> record their fourth album, A Night at the Opera but leave EMI when executive Ray Foster refuses to have 
            the six-minute song "Bohemian Rhapsody" released as the album's first single. Freddie has Capital Radio DJ Kenny Everett debut the song on the airwaves. Despite mixed reviews, "Bohemian Rhapsody" becomes a smash hit. 
            Shortly after the band's world tour, Freddie begins an affair with Paul Prenter, his personal manager. Mary breaks up with Freddie when he comes out to her as bisexual, although she assures him that he is gay.
        </p>

        <p>
            The band's success continues through to the early 1980s, but tensions arise over the direction of their music and a change in Freddie's attitude. In 1981, after a lavish party at his home, Freddie falls in love with Jim Hutton, 
            one of the waiters at the party. They shortly part ways, with Jim telling Freddie to look for him when he learns to like himself. The band's press conference to promote their 1982 album Hot Space is hijacked by the press, who 
            bombard Freddie with questions on his personal life and sexuality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Freddie's relationship with his bandmates sours when he announces that he has signed a $4 million deal with CBS Records to go solo. He moves to Munich in 1984 to work on his first solo album Mr. Bad Guy and engage in gay orgies 
            with Paul. Mary, now married and pregnant, visits and urges him to return to the band, as they have been offered a spot in Bob Geldof's benefit concert Live Aid at Wembley Stadium. Discovering that Paul withheld this news from him, 
            Freddie, enraged, severs ties with him. In retaliation, Paul goes public about Freddie's sexual escapades. With the outbreak of AIDS spreading worldwide, Freddie has himself tested and discovers he is infected.
        </p>

        <p>
            Freddie returns to London to ask for forgiveness from his bandmates and their manager Jim Beach. They reconcile and are given a last-minute slot in Live Aid. During a rehearsal, Freddie reveals to his band mates that he has AIDS, 
            and they embrace him. On the day of Live Aid, he reunites with Hutton and Mary, and reconnects with his family with his father's Zoroastrian maxim, "Good thoughts, good words, good deeds." 
            <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN</span>'s Live Aid performance is a massive success, helping increase the rate of donations during the event.
        </p>

        <p>
            After Freddie's death from AIDS in 1991, Beach and the remaining members of Queen create the Mercury Phoenix Trust to help combat the spread of AIDS worldwide.
