    <h1>The Mercury Phoenix Trust</h1>

    <a href="http://www.mercuryphoenixtrust.com/"><img src="trust.jpg" height="275px" width="275px" alt="BoRhoPoster" align="left" style="padding-right: 30px; padding-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 20px"/></a>
    
    <p>
        The Mercury Phoenix Trust was founded by Brian May, Roger Taylor and their manager Jim Beach in memory of rock band 
        <span style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px";>QUEEN's</span> iconic lead singer FREDDIE MERCURY who died in 1991 from AIDS.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the last 21 years the Trust has given away over 15 million dollars in his name and funded over 700 projects in the global battle against HIV/AIDS.
    </p>
            
    <p>
        We need your support to maintain our present donor level and to keep funding the desperately needed HIV/AIDS initiatives globally. 
        Together, help us to use Freddie’s memory, his charisma and drive to eradicate this disease.
    </p>

    <p>     
        We give to a wide range of Education and Awareness projects, principally targeting young people in the developing world. The 18 million orphans who have lost one or both 
        parents to AIDS are in desperate need of help as they struggle to survive and build their lives, often becoming ‘head of the family’ for their smaller siblings.
    </p>

    <p>
        This disease impacts on the whole community, down to the grandparents who find themselves caring for their dead children’s children. They too need aid and information. 
        The way to combat this disease is through knowledge.
    </p>
            
    <p>   
        Although we give to the large NGOs and well known charities, the greater part of our funding goes direct to small grassroots organizations which the bigger charities tend 
        to overlook, and where we feel the recipients will achieve value for money.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        The projects we fund are spread across the globe and in total we have now given to projects in 57 countries – wherever we can help we do.
    </p>
